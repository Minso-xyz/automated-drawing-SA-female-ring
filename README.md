# Automatic drawing creator (Self-aligning ring)

### Overview
Normally it takes HOURS to prepare just one drawing; 
1. Calculate multiple formulas to define the profile
2. Design each component on CAD program
3. Analyze tolerances of each component
4. Quote a bunch of dimensions on the drawing
5. Insert all the information of project (Component)
6. Finally export the drawing in a PDF (and other formats) and store all the files in an assigned folder.

This automatic drawing creater will save you from all the hustles above and generate a drawing automatically in a few seconds!

8. Signature. Put the name of who use this application and generate a drawing.
9. Check box of "Drawing for a third party". When you check this box, it helps you sensor some confidential information on the drawing (Such as nominal dimension, the name of product).

After you click "OK", the following 4 types of file will be automatically generated in the folder C:\Test.
