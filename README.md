# Automatic drawing creator (Self-aligning ring)

### Overview
Normally it takes HOURS to prepare just one drawing; 
1. Calculate multiple formulas to define the profile
2. Design each component on CAD program
3. Analyze tolerances of each component
4. Quote a bunch of dimensions on the drawing
5. Insert all the information of project (Component)
6. Finally export the drawing in a PDF (and other formats) and store all the files in an assigned folder.

This automatic drawing creater will save you from all the hustles above and generate a drawing automatically in a few seconds!
